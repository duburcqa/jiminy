    "# An introduction to Jiminy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Jiminy is a simulation framework built around the `pinocchio` rigidbody dynamics library, targeting the simulation of robotic systems. This document covers the use of jiminy in python for individual robotic simulation: usage in C++ is similar, see C++ API documentation and examples. For information about using jiminy in a learning context with Gym OpenAI, see examples in gym_jiminy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jiminy supports the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Simulating a single robot, represented by a URDF, with possible ground interaction (modeled as a spring-damper interaction). Note that interaction force is only applied at user-specified points, there is no mesh collision handling in jiminy.\n",
    " - Adding joint flexibility, modeled as a Serie-Elastic actuator.\n",
    " - Applying external forces on the system.\n",
    " - Applying kinematic constraints, such as fixed-body constraints.\n",
    " - Simulalting multiple robots interacting, including closed kinematic trees.\n",
    " - Adding basic sensors on the system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic example\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the first part of this tutorial, we will use as example the stabilization of a simple inverted pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jiminy simulation rely on interfacing three fundamental objects : a Robot, a Controller, defining input for this robot, and an Engine, performing the integration. For convenience, connection between these objects is handled in python by the BasicSimulator class (this class does not exist in C++). Of course, it is always possible to instanciate these objects manually for more specific usage - see the unit tests for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot is constructed from a URDF of course - this builds a jiminy.Model object - but extra information needs to be provided as well for a simulation: which sensors to use and what are their caracteristic ? Which joints have a motor attached and what are its properties ? What are the contact points with the ground (if any) ? All this are informations gathered to build a full robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's get our first example running: we set the inverted pendulum away from its upward position and watch it fall."
