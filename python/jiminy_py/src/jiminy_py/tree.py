"""Generic helpers for manipulating arbitrarily nested data structure with
easy. All these functions are reasonably fast, but they aim at convenience
of use and versatility rather with optimal performance.

.. note::
    This module mirrors the API of the `dm-tree` package that was originally
    developed by Google Deepmind but is not longer actively maintained.
    Internally, the implementation is completely different.

.. warning::
    A node is considered as a leaf unless its type derives from either
    `collection.abc.Mapping`, `collections.abc.Sequence` or
    `collections.abc.Set`.

.. warning::
    Unlike `dm-tree`, all functions preserves key ordering instead of sorting
    them.
