"""This method gathers base implementations for blocks to be used in pipeline
control design.

It implements:
- the concept of block thats can be connected to a `BaseJiminyEnv` environment
  through multiple `JiminyEnvInterface` indirections
- a base controller block, along with a concrete PD controller
- a wrapper to combine a controller block and a `BaseJiminyEnv` environment,

    The output command 'cmd_X' of 'ctrl_X' must be consistent with the action
    space 'act_X' of the subsequent block. The action space of the resulting
    unified environment will be the action space of the highest-level
    controller 'act_N', while its observation space will be the one of the
    unwrapped environment 'obs'. Alternatively, the later can also gather the
    (stacked) action space of the successive controllers if one is to observe
    the intermediary controllers' targets.

    .. note::
        The environment and the controllers all have their own update period.

    .. warning::
        This design is not suitable for learning the controllers 'ctrl_X', but
        rather for robotic-oriented pre-defined and possibly model-based
        controllers, such as PID control, inverse kinematics, admittance
        control, or Model Predictive Control (MPC). It is recommended to add
        the controllers into the policy itself if it has to be trainable.
