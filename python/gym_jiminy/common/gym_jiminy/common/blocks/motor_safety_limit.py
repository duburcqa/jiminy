    """Safety mechanism primarily designed to prevent hardware damage and
    premature wear, but also to temper violent, sporadic and dangerous motions.

    A velocity limit v+ is enforced by bounding the commanded effort such that
    no effort can be applied to push the joint beyond the velocity limit, and
    a damping effort is applied if the joint is moving at a velocity beyond
    the limit, ie -kd * (v - v+).

    When the joint is near the soft limits x+/-, the velocities are bounded to
    keep the position from crossing the soft limits. The k_position term
    determines the scale of the bound on velocity, ie v+/- = -kp * (x - x+/-).
    These bounds on velocity are the ones determining the bounds on effort.

        The prescribed position and velocity limits may be more respective that
        the actual hardware specification of the robot.
