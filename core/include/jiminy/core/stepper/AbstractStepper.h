/// \brief      Generic interface for a stepper to integrate the equation of dynamics.
///
/// \details    The generalized position of a mechanical system evolves not in a vector space,
///             but in a Lie group: this is visible for instance in the fact that quaternions
///             have four components, but only three are meaningful, as quaternion must remain
///             unitary to represent a rotation. As such, the velocity vector v is not the
///             term-by-term derivative of the configuration q.
///             This means that classical stepper implementations cannot be used as is: this
///             class thus defines an interface for implementing variable-step numerical
///             solvers on this type of system.
