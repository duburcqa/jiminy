# Jiminy C++ documentation

Jiminy is an open-source C++ simulator of poly-articulated systems. It is maintained by [Wandercraft Team](https://www.wandercraft.eu/en/), and available on [Github](https://github.com/Wandercraft/jiminy).

This page contains only the Doxygen documentation for C++ code. It is automatically generated. A README is available on the Github. Take a look to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Wandercraft/jiminy/wiki) for more information.

## Usage

This documentation groups together all the native C++ code, that is part of the Jiminy project.

  - Documentation for the package sources is available by three different tabs:

    - [Packages](./namespaces.html), where file are sorted by C++ package.
    - [Classes](./annotated.html), where only C++ classes are listed.
    - [Files](./files.html), where one may browse the file directory tree directly. This is the most complete reference. Indeed, some file might be inaccessible from the other two interfaces.
