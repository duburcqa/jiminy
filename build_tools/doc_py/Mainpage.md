# Jiminy python documentation

Jiminy is an open-source C++ simulator of poly-articulated systems. It is maintained by [Wandercraft Team](https://www.wandercraft.eu/en/), and available on [Github](https://github.com/Wandercraft/jiminy).

This page contains only the Doxygen documentation for Python code. It is automatically generated. A README is available on the Github. Take a look to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Wandercraft/jiminy/wiki) for more information.

## Usage

This documentation groups together all the native Python code and bindings, that is part of the jiminy project. The source code is split in several python packages, each containing both source code for the package and command line scripts, both of which are covered here.

- For a list of command-line tools (standalone scripts that can be called from the command line), refer to the [Command Line Scripts](./group__scripts.html) page.

- Documentation for the package sources is available by three different tabs:

  - [Packages](./namespaces.html), where file are sorted by python package.
  - [Classes](./annotated.html), where only python classes are listed.
  - [Files](./files.html), where one may browse the file directory tree directly. This is the most complete reference. Indeed, some file might be inaccessible from the other two interfaces.

- Python bindings of the C++ source code are documented as well: typically look for \<ClassName\>Visitor class.
